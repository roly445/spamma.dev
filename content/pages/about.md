Spamma is an open-source, self-hosted SMTP capture platform for engineers. It pairs a real SMTP server with a Blazor WebAssembly UI so teams can test, debug, and audit email flows without sending mail to third parties. The project follows Clean Architecture with CQRS and event sourcing to keep boundaries clear and behavior observable.
